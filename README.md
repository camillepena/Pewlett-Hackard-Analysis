# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

In this challenge, we will be creating tables to show our client, Pewlett Hackard their employees eligible for retirement and their employees eligible for a mentor program to mitigate mass retirements. We will also look into the further implications of Pewlett Hackard's coming retirements.

## Results: 

-The first major point to be seen from the Unique Titles table is that Pewlett Hackard is going to be losing a significant concentration of senior and leadership positions.  Senior Engineers are predicted to lose approximately 26,000 from their ranks this will account approximately 9% of the total workforce and approximately36% of all Senior Engineers. 

-Senior Staff has similar problems as Senior Engineers.  It will account for approximately 8% of their total workforce and approximately 35% of the total Senior Staff.

-The first major point we realize quickly looking at the mentorship table is how small the table is in comparison to the entire workforce and the workers eligible for retirement.  The employees eligible with the given parameters is less than 1% of the entire workforce.

-We can also see that we have one less title than we do in other titles tables.  There is no one available to mentor a manager which given their relatively small proportion to the company can be insignificant or significant.

## Summary![mentor_titles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97993428/163570222-15603d04-b812-4fc6-b8ed-b4ad550bf010.png)


No, there are not enough employees to mentor the incoming employees.  In all titles, there are less than 1% of mentors available to mentor.  Unless, Pewlett Hackard broadens their requirements its hard to see how they will even begin to make a difference in the outflow of employees vs the inflow of qualified employees especially at senior levels.  Unless Pewlett Hackard expands the boundaries of their mentor program requirements or they structure a completely new set of boudaries to better serve their upcoming exodus.  

To give perspective to the scope of the problem of mentoring and of the upcoming exodus, I included two additional simple counts of the total counts of all job titles within Pewlett Hackard and within the mentor eligible employees.  These additional tables with the retiring titles shows us the large differences between the initial problem of their being a significant percentage of employees retiring, especially from senior positions, and then the bigger problem of not having mentors available to train.

Pewlett Hackard should reexamine their mentor program.  While the mass exodus is a considerable problem, it will be short term compared to the inability to train properly with guidance from a mentor.  While Pewlett Hackard can hire and promote with relative ease to lessen the impact in coming years, it is much harder to train and retain that workforce.
